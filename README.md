# Project---Personal-Narrative



**Project Overview**
Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

**My Project:**

In my project I wanted to show my love for a game I play with friends called StarCraft. I wanted to teach users the 3 main Races in the game while also including filters to bring them to life.


The 4 video filters I used are:

-highlightBlue
  This filter creates a blue shade over the image but also pops out any yellow colors while highlighting the blue color.

-pixelate
  This filter creates a pixelated version of the image making it give a video game look to the picture by taking the average of a certian length of 
pixels and changing them to specific color.

-makePurple
  This filter creates a purple shade by taking the average of a certian length of pixels and changing them to a specific level of RGB to make it appear purple.

-motionBlur
  This filter creates a blurred view over the image to make it look like its almost moving.
